# Wordpress - React - Typescript

A Wordpress development environment for React + Typescript themes. This repo is
your primary choice if you'd like to develop a **React Typescript based
WordPress theme that runs in a devcontainer**.

## Usage

### Usage with a new project

This is the list you should follow if you are using this repo to start a new
project.

1. Use the template to create your own repo, then clone it on your dev machine.

1. Create an `.env` file with the following variables:

   - `THEME_NAME`: The name for the theme that you are developing. For safety
     reasons, this property value can only consist of characters: a-z A-Z 0-9
     and dash (-)
   - `DB_USER`: Username for WordPress' MySql access
   - `DB_PASS`: Password for WordPress' MySql access
   - `DB_NAME`: Name for the schema that WordPress will use
   - `DB_ROOT_PASS`: MySql root user password

1. Run `./wrt.sh bootstrap` to set the theme name, build the containers and
   download the dependencies. This operation may take a while.

1. Start your devcontainer.

1. If you have a WordPress database backup, you can include the steps from the
   section **Usage with pre-existing database image** at this step. If you do,
   the next step may not apply for your case.

1. Open localhost (or your ip, if you prefer that) and do the all-too-familiar
   WordPress setup.

1. Once the setup is done, go to wp-admin -> Appearance -> Themes and select
   your React theme. Its name will be "theme".

1. Visit your site or press F5\* and watch the spinning React logo.

### Usage with a pre-existing React project

This is the list you should follow if you are adapting a pre-existing React
project as a WordPress theme.

1. Follow the points 1, 2 and 3 from section **Usage with a new project**.

1. Copy the `src` content of the pre-exiting React project inside `src` folder
   of this repo. Please note that you are only copying the `src` folder, not the
   entire React project.

1. Copy files from `public` folder into this repo's `public` folder. Note that
   this repo contains a `style.css` file that is not normally needed by React.
   However, WordPress uses stylesheets to validate its themes. Make sure that
   the file provided by this repo or some legally formatted `style.css` is
   available in `public`. WordPress doesn't require this file to be imported by
   `index.html`.

1. Adapt the `package.json` of this repo with the dependencies and other
   properties of the pre-existing React project's `package.json`.

1. Start your devcontainer. Note that this may take a while as some packages
   will be added to the WordPress image (such as Git).

1. If you have a WordPress database backup, you can include the steps from the
   section **Usage with pre-existing database image** at this step.

1. Go to wp-admin -> Appearance -> Themes and select your React theme. Its name
   will be the name specified in `style.css`.

1. Visit your site or press F5\* and see your pre-existing React project being
   served by WordPress.

### Usage with a pre-existing WordPress database image

If you want to use a pre-existing WordPress database image, follow the steps
below:

1. Place your db backup in `backups/sql` and run `./wrt.sh db restore`. You can
   refer to the **Scripts** section of this readme to learn more about the usage
   of the said script.

1. You may have the need to update the WordPress home url. For this, you can run
   `./wrt.sh db replace-url` to correct the previous WordPress home url with the
   one you want to use for your dev environment. This may be localhost or some
   ip/url you'd like to set. Please refer to **Scripts** section of this readme
   to learn more about the said script.

## Api

The repo comes with tools that will help you manage your theme, WordPress
database backups and docker containers. If you choose to populate the related
script files, it can also structure your access to your project's production
environment.

Your entrypoint for the api is `./wrt.sh`. You can set an alias through the
command `alias wrt="./wrt.sh"`, which would make typing out the commands easier.

Top-level commands for the wrt api are listed below:

| Command    | Action                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)     | Show help information                                                      |
| bootstrap  | Set the theme name and download the dependencies                           |
| db         | Tools for managing the WordPress MySQL database                            |
| docker     | Manage your project's Docker containers                                    |
| production | Communicate with the project's production environment, pull and push items |
| theme      | Build, clean, package the theme                                            |

For a detailed explanation of the api, please click [here](./API.md).

All endpoints except for a few within the `production` api have their own help
documentation. You can access these using the flags `-h` or `--help`.

## Utility functions

Wrt provides some utility functions to help you implement custom scripts for
your own needs, as well as for use with `production` api scripts. You can find a
list of these [here](./SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md)

## Repo management note

Please note that React source files are not a separate repository. This entire
codebase is governed as a single entity. This is different from regular React
projects where one folder above React src is typically the repo root.
