# Wrt Api

Wordpress - React - Typescript Api entrypoint is `./wrt.sh`. For readability,
the rest of this guide is going to assume that the following alias is set:

```bash
alias wrt="./wrt.sh"
```

## Getting command line help

All methods with some exceptions under the `production` api, offer help
documentation through `-h` and `--help` flags. You can refer to these for
on-the-fly refreshers.

## Top-level api: wrt [options] [command]

The top-level api consists of the following commands:

| Command    | Action                                                                     |

| Flags      | Params | Action                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help |        | Show help information |

### wrt db [options] [command]

Parent for controlling development WordPress database. The children consist of
the following:

| Command          | Action                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| (none)           | Show help information                          |
| backup           | Create a backup of the current wp database     |

| replace-home-url | Replace the wp home url                        |

| Flags      | Params | Action                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help |        | Show help information |

#### wrt db backup [options]

Creates a sql backup of the development environment WordPress MySQL database. By
default, the created file will have a name with the format: `[date]-[time].sql`.
However, it's possible to define a custom name through the flag `-f`.

| Command | Action                      |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| (none)  | Run the db backup operation |

| Flags          | Params         | Action                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| -f, --filename | [sql filename] | Custom filename for the backup file that will be created |
| -h, --help     |                | Show help information                                    |

#### wrt db get-home-url [options]

Returns the currently active WordPress home url. If this setting doesn't match
the url that you are using to browse your site, then you won't be able to open
most pages as WordPress will redirect the request to the home url. You can
change the home url setting to any address that you need using
`wrt db replace-home-url` api.

| Command | Action                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| (none)  | Return the currently active WordPress home url |

| Flags      | Params | Action                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help |        | Show help information |

#### wrt db replace-home-url [options]

Replaces the WordPress `home` url value in settings, posts and all other places
it appears. By default, the api will replace `home` with `localhost` but it's
possible to define a custom value through the flag `-n`.

If you are doing development on a pre-existing database image, it's possible
that you may see WordPress redirecting your requests, followed by your browser
telling you the page is not working. This is because WordPress is redirecting
your browser using the `home` value inside `wp_options` schema, which results in
a failing page load. Replacing the `home` url fixes this issue.

After the development on your WordPress project is complete, you may have the
need to run the same command to replace your dev address with your site's public
address. Otherwise, your production instance may redirect you to the setting you
use in your dev environment.

| Command | Action                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| (none)  | Run the url replacement operation |

| Flags         | Params | Action                                               |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| -n, --new-url | [url]  | Url to which the current home url shall be corrected |
| -h, --help    |        | Show help information                                |

#### wrt db restore [options]

Restores a sql image placed inside `backups/sql` directory. By default, this
command will restore the most recent image by creation date inside the
directory. But it's possible to set a particular restoration file through the
flag `-f`.

| Command | Action                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| (none)  | Run the db restore operation |

| Flags          | Params         | Action                      |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| -f, --filename | [sql filename] | Restores the given sql file |
| -h, --help     |                | Show help information       |

### wrt docker [options] [command]

This repo creates a devcontainer environment for your WordPress project,
ensuring isolation between the host machine and the development. Which means
that, as long as this repo is used in the way it was intended, you will have 2
containers running:

- ${THEME_NAME}\_\_wp\_\_dev: WordPress container
- ${THEME_NAME}\_\_db\_\_dev: MySQL container

Wrt provides you with some tools to handle containerization details.

| Command | Action                                                                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)  | Show help information                                                            |
| prune   | Remove containers, volumes and networks associated with your wrt dev environment |
| stop    | Stop devcontainers                                                               |

| Flags      | Params | Action                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help |        | Show help information |

#### wrt docker prune [options]

By default, this repo does not clean up its devcontainers. Instead, you are
offered the `prune` api to easily stop and remove the containers, volumes, and
networks associated with your development environment.

Before the removal, the command also takes a database backup and puts it inside
`backups/sql`.

| Command | Action                                                    |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)  | Take a sql backup and then run the docker prune operation |

| Flags                 | Params         | Action                     |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| -n, --no-backup       |                | Skip taking the sql backup |
| -b, --backup-filename | [sql filename] | Set custom sql filename    |
| -h, --help            |                | Show help information      |

#### wrt docker stop [options]

Allows you to stop all repo related devcontainers at once.

| Command | Action                    |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| (none)  | Stop repo's devcontainers |

| Flags      | Params | Action                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help |        | Show help information |

### wrt production [options] [command]

Api for controlling production side for your project. This api mostly consists
of placeholder scripts which you can alter to create an intuitive access to your
production files and settings.

Wrt provides you with some utility scripts which you can use to integrate your
production scripts with the general structure of this repo. To read more about
these, please click [here](./SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md)

This repo was written with the assumption that after the development is
complete, the WordPress theme and the sql data created will be running on a
traditional environment with no containers, no orchestration and maybe just a
single instance. So, the api was designed to account for pulling and pushing
uploads, theme, and other components of the WordPress production in pieces.

Though I see no reason why this repo could not be adapted to service a more
scalable architecture. A Docker / Kubernetes push endpoint for images could be
easily included in this repo. If you get to that before I do, you are very much
welcome to send a PR.
